# Modbus Converter Library

This is a bridge demo between Modbus/ASCII/RTU and MODBUS/TCPIP. The serial port is connected to a Modbus/ASCII or MODBUS/RTU device, while the Ethernet port is connected to the server. Commands are sent from the server via Ethernet, and the slave device gets these after they've been converted.
